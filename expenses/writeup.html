			My Application
		</h2>
		<p>
			this application provides the ease of easily, efficiently and with a very simplistic
			design to enter information into a json file(though id didnt manage the PUSH). 
			nontheless, it involves the expenses of a couple and helps in keeping track on their depts
			to themselves in a cloud platform which enables the access from anywhere once internet access
			is available.
